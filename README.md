## App Introduction

Bobplace means place where you have meals (Bob means meal in korean).

The number of people who uses food delivery service is increasing and the delivery fee is getting expensive nowadays. Therefore many people starts to use pick up service to save the delivery fee.

- Expensive delivery fee is a burden to users and small restaurant owners
- We motivate users to go outside to have meals using points
- We provide a better way the small restaurant owners to get customers with better business margin.

Bobplace is an app that uses gamification to encourage users to go outside to have the meals to and solve the problem of delivery fee. I have developed two apps one for customers and one for restaurant owners.
